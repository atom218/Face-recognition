# Face-recognition
this project uses python to perform face recogntion and identify all faces in the given frame
there are multiple codes attached with it 
1st one is simple face recognation based on training data where the program will identify anyone by name and put a box around their face 
2nd one is a little more complex which involves logging the data of every face occured in the frame on a table in mysql
